# Time is of the e-scent: Time Relationships in Food.com
by Eric Gan

---

## Introduction
Food.com is a popular recipe-sharing website allowing users to share and rate recipes. In many rating sites, I have observed grade inflation, where, over time, ratings become more lenient. I wondered: How did time affect recipes and reviews on the site? To answer this question, I analyzed two datasets of recipes and reviews of Food.com posted since 2008.

Recipes is a dataset with 83,782 rows and 13 columns.

Of the columns, we are interested in: 
- ‘id’: Recipe ID
- ‘minutes’: Minutes to prepare recipe
- ‘submitted’: Date recipe was submitted
- ‘tags’: Food.com tags for recipe
- ‘nutrition’: Nutritional information
- ‘n_steps’: Number of steps in recipe
- ‘n_ingredients’: Number of ingredients in the recipe
- ‘description’: Description of the recipe


Interactions is a dataset with 731,927 rows and 5 columns, which contains the reviews that were left on the recipes.

We are interested in: 
- ‘recipe_id’: The ID of the recipe that was reviewed
- ‘date’: the date of the review
- ‘rating’: Rating given
- ‘review’: The review text
